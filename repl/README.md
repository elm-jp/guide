This plugin was developed by looking at the following links:

- [This page](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/blob/master/docs/plugins/testing.md) describes how to develop locally, but it does not quite work.
- This [youtube plugin](https://github.com/GitbookIO/plugin-youtube/blob/1.1.0/index.js) for how to set the plugin up.
- This [exercises plugin](https://github.com/GitbookIO/plugin-exercises/blob/3.0.0/assets/exercises.js#L142-L150) for how to initialize elements when transitioning to a new page.
